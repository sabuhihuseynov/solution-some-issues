# Solution Some Problems

This repository is a collection of Java-based solutions to various algorithmic challenges, primarily from **LeetCode**, alongside implementations of common design patterns and utility classes. It serves as a personal reference for problem-solving techniques and clean code practices in Java.

## 🚀 Features

* **Algorithmic Solutions**: Includes a wide range of LeetCode problems categorized by difficulty (Easy, Medium, Hard).
* **Design Patterns**: Practical implementations of Creational, Structural, and Behavioral design patterns.
* **Game Logic**: Implementations of classic games like Hangman, Tic-Tac-Toe, and Ship Battle.
* **Utility Tools**: Helper classes for JWT handling, date manipulation, and common calculations.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

* **Language**: Java 21
* **Build Tool**: Maven
* **Lombok**: To reduce boilerplate code.
* **JJWT (Java JWT)**: For JSON Web Token implementation.



## 📁 Project Structure

The project is organized into logical packages within `src/main/java/org/example/`:

* `algorithms/`: Searching and sorting algorithm implementations.
* `designpatterns/`: Sub-packages for Creational, Structural, and Behavioral patterns.
* `games/`: Console-based game implementations.
* `interview/`: Curated interview questions and solutions.
* `numproblems/` & `stringproblems/`: Specialized LeetCode solutions for numeric and string manipulation.
* `util/`: Utility classes for security (JWT), dates, and general math.
